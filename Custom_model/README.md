# Training custom model with Tensorflow and Google Colab Pro

Smart Traffic custom model was trained with TensorFlow and TensorFlow object detection API on Google Colab Pro. The steps on how to train custom model is based on [techzizou's tutorial](https://medium.com/geekculture/training-a-model-for-custom-object-detection-using-tensorflow-1-x-on-google-colab-564d3e62e9ef). However, some codes have been adjusted and it is best to follow [trainmodel.ipynb]().

## Detailed steps on how to train custom model

1. **First,** download and prepare the following files:
1.1 Images for data training. (For Smart Traffic, the total images used for training is 310 .jpg files). It is advised that there are 300+ images for better data training.
1.2 Label all the images with
