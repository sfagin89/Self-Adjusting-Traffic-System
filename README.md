# SmartTraffic
A System to improve traffic congestion using 'smart' traffic lights

## MVP
A smart traffic light system that is able to recognize, count, and determine the directionality of vehicles at its intersection.

## A successful finished product should include the following:
1. The individual nodes (1 per intersection), should recognized the presense of vehicles, be able to count them, and determine their direction relative to the current intersection.
2. The nodes should be able to communicate between each other, passing and receiving intersection traffic information.
3. An algorithm that the nodes can use to determine how traffic lights should be adjusted to improve traffic flow in areas of congested traffic, based on the traffic information at their node, as well as all other nodes they hold traffic information for.

## If the above is finished, a reach goal will be attempted:
* Securing the individual nodes and the communication between them to prevent compromised nodes. While security will be taken into account during the main project, additional, redundant security will be considered here.
